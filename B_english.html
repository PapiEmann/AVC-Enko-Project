      <h2>Project Background</h2>
      <p>This project was developed as part of my personnal project where we were asked to do something that helps other people and makes us learn something,<br>that is realistic, and we can say it’s a service. <br>This project will help us in real life scenarios to live in a community and to help others by resolving a problem and creating solutions. <br> I chose to create educational content on important health topics. I chose to focus on strokes because someone very, very dear to me, who played a really important, <br>even crucial role in my life, suffered a mini-stroke, also known as a TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack), and is now very exposed to stroke. <br>This person was my second mother, who educated me and took me under her wing, but she's getting pretty old,<br> which means she's exposed to potentially fatal illnesses like stroke, <br>and I thought the least I could do to help people like me who have a loved one they want to help but don't know how by making this site.</p>

 <!-- What is a Stroke? -->
 <section id="what-is-stroke" class="py-5">
  <div class="container" style="text-align: center;">
    <h2>What is a Stroke?</h2>
    <p>A stroke is a medical emergency <br> that occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, <br>depriving brain tissue of oxygen and essential nutrients. <br>This can lead to brain cell death within minutes. <br> Strokes can be classified into two main types:</p>
    <ul>
      <strong>Ischemic Stroke:</strong> Caused by a blood clot or blockage in an artery supplying the brain.
      <strong>Hemorrhagic Stroke:</strong> Caused by the rupture of a blood vessel, leading to bleeding in or around the brain.
    </ul>
    <p>There is also a <strong>Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)</strong>, often called a mini-stroke, <br> which is a temporary blockage without lasting damage but serves as a warning for potential future strokes.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- How Does a Stroke Work? -->
<section id="how-stroke-works" class="py-5">
  <div class="container" style="text-align: center;">
    <h2>How Does a Stroke Work?</h2>
    <p>When a stroke occurs, <br> the affected brain region is deprived of oxygen, <br>causing brain cells to begin dying rapidly. <br> The severity of the stroke depends on the duration and extent of the blood supply blockage.</p>
    <p>Since different parts of the brain control different functions, <br>the consequences of a stroke vary widely depending on the affected area. <br>Loss of function may include speech impairment, paralysis, cognitive dysfunction, <br> and other neurological deficits.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Effects and Symptoms of a Stroke -->
<section id="symptoms" class="py-5">
  <div class="container" style="text-align: center;">
    <h2>Effects and Symptoms of a Stroke</h2>
    <p>The symptoms of a stroke appear suddenly and can include:</p>
    <ul>
      Paralysis or weakness on one side of the body.
      Difficulty speaking or understanding speech.
      Vision problems, including blindness in one or both eyes.
      Loss of balance, dizziness, or lack of coordination.
      Severe headaches with no known cause.
    </ul>
    <p>Additional symptoms may include confusion, fatigue, and trouble swallowing. <br> If any of these symptoms appear suddenly, emergency medical attention is required immediately.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- What Happens to the Body During a Stroke? -->
<section id="body-during-stroke" class="py-5">
  <div class="container" style="text-align: center;">
    <h2>What Happens to the Body During a Stroke?</h2>
    <p>When blood flow to the brain is restricted or completely cut off:</p>
    <ul>
      Brain cells begin to die due to oxygen deprivation.
      The affected area of the brain loses function, <br> causing symptoms like muscle weakness or loss of speech.
      In severe cases, permanent damage or death can occur.
      The body may experience systemic responses such as inflammation, <br>increased blood pressure, or cardiac stress.
    </ul>
    <p>The effects depend on the part of the brain involved. <br>For example, a stroke in the left hemisphere may cause speech and language impairment, <br>while a stroke in the right hemisphere may affect spatial awareness and movement.</p>
  </div>

<!-- How Does a Stroke Feel? -->
<section id="how-stroke-feels" class="py-5">
  <div class="container" style="text-align: center;">
    <h2>How Does a Stroke Feel?</h2>
    <p>People who experience a stroke often describe:</p>
    <ul>
      A sudden and severe headache.
      Numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body.
      Confusion and disorientation.
      A sensation of vertigo or dizziness.
      A feeling of heaviness or inability to move certain body parts.
    </ul>
    <p>In some cases, individuals may not recognize the symptoms until significant damage has occurred, <br>which is why rapid response is critical.</p>

    <h2>How to Help Someone Having a Stroke?</h2>
    <p>Acting quickly can save a life. Use the FAST method to recognize stroke symptoms:</p>
    <ul>
      <strong>Face:</strong> Ask the person to smile. Is one side of their face drooping?
      <strong>Arm:</strong> Ask them to raise both arms. Does one drift downward?
      <strong>Speech:</strong> Ask them to repeat a simple sentence. Is their speech slurred?
      <strong>Time:</strong> If any of these signs are present, call emergency services immediately.
    </ul>
    <p>Every second counts. Quick medical intervention improves survival rates and recovery outcomes.</p>
